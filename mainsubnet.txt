i have one router and three switches each switch is connected to two pcs 
marketing has 25 , sales has 15 and hr has 10 the 
ip 192.168.1.0/24 
provide subnetting accordingly

Alright, let's subnet the network according to your requirements:

Given:

Marketing requires 25 hosts.
Sales requires 15 hosts.
HR requires 10 hosts.
IP range: 192.168.1.0/24
To accommodate these requirements, we can subnet the network as follows:

Marketing Department:

Subnet: 192.168.1.0/27
IP Range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.30
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224 (/27)
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.31
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Sales Department:

Subnet: 192.168.1.32/28
IP Range: 192.168.1.33 - 192.168.1.46
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240 (/28)
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.47
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.33
HR Department:

Subnet: 192.168.1.48/28
IP Range: 192.168.1.49 - 192.168.1.62
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240 (/28)
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.63
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.49
This configuration provides separate subnets for each department, each with sufficient addresses to accommodate their respective number of hosts.

Now, let's assign each switch to its respective department and configure the router accordingly:

Router Configuration:

Interface connecting to Marketing VLAN:
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224 (/27)
Interface connecting to Sales VLAN:
IP Address: 192.168.1.33
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240 (/28)
Interface connecting to HR VLAN:
IP Address: 192.168.1.49
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240 (/28)
Switch Configuration:

Switch 1:
Connected to Marketing and Sales Departments
Switch 2:
Connected to Marketing and HR Departments
Switch 3:
Connected to Sales and HR Departments
Each switch should be configured with VLANs corresponding to their respective departments, and their ports should be appropriately assigned.
